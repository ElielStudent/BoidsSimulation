Each flock has an id
Boids of the same flock fly together with the rules
When they find another bird from another flock, they avoid it
Same with obstacles
All boids are stored in a list, and moved around in the global quadtree 
every frame
In the side bar screen i will hold the settings (using another view) where
i can switch between "game modes" like the predator simulation, the neural network,
and the main ones. Youll start  over each one every time you click it, and you can make a reset
function to put a "blank canvas"

Priorities on the collision detection for the boids

Neural network gets area around him as input and outputs a vector (?) containing which direction to
rotate, and the "urgency" or how much it should rotate/maybe speed?


Make a global game class, and then a menu/simulation game class that inherits from it
